# Explore writing Jupyter Notebooks with the Basilisp Kernel

[Basilisp](https://github.com/basilisp-lang/basilisp) is a Lisp implementation broadly compatible with Clojure, running on the Python VM. Refer to the [documentation](https://basilisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to get started.

## Overview

This repository helps you explore writing [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks in [Basilisp](https://basilisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Clojure using the [basilisp-kernel](https://github.com/ikappaki/basilisp-kernel).

It assumes you have some familiarity with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/clojure) and Jupyter Notebooks in Python.

It leverages the Poetry build tool to create a Python virtual environment that includes both the `Jupyter Notebook` and the `basilisp-kernel` dependencies to get you started. Additionally, it includes a sample Basilisp Application library (`basapp`) that can be loaded into the development notebook.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed to manage the Python virtual environment.

## Project Setup

First, clone the repo locally
```
git clone https://github.com/ikappaki/basilex-notebook.git
```

Before running the project for the first time, install the dependencies in a new virtual environment by running
```shell
poetry install
```

You can add additional Python or Basilisp libraries at any time using the `add` command. For example to install `matplotlib`
```shell
poetry add matplotlib
```

## Usage

Activate the virtual environment by running
```shell
poetry shell
```

Then, start the Jupyter Notebook server
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

This should open the Jupyter Notebook home page in your browser. Open the `dev.ipynb` notebook to begin interacting with it.

The [src/basapp/core.lpy](src/basapp/core.lpy) is in the python `sys.path` through `poetry install` run at project setup. You can require it in the Notebook as normal
```clojure
[1] (require '[basapp.core :as bc])

[2] (bc/hello)
:Hi 👋 The Basilisp Kernel supports autocompletion of functions and variables using the Tab key ⌨️. Give it a go!
```

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to restart the notebook kernel to pick up any changes to the `basapp` code after using `require`.

## REPL

You can acccess the Basilisp REPL from the command line as usual
```
$ basilisp repl
basilisp.user=>
```

🄑 An empty file indicating to Clojure-enabled editors that this is a Basilisp Project.

🄝 The root of the sample Basilisp App namespace.

① The development Notebook set up to use the `basilisp-kernel`.

② A lock file generated by Poetry that records the exact versions of dependencies installed.

③ The configuration file where project metadata, dependencies, and Poetry settings are defined.

④ The core namespace of the sample Basilisp App.
